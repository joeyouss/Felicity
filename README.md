## The only thing positive here is the environment!
**Objective:**
1. To teach people open source and web development with carefully commented pieces of code.
2. To show how an idea of helping others could be put into action with the help of technology.

The idea of this website is to bring positive and impactful stories from past and present which may impact the people positively.
Times have been tough and many of us have been not been at our best lately and/or are struggling with mental peace. The only idea behind this page was spreading hope, positivity and doing our bit to help other peeple in whichever way possible.
No place for sad happenings, only a place to get motivated, read happiness and deliver the best.
Yes, the world isn't perfect but we try to make it a bit better- one article at a time.
If you believe you can, you can.

## AI-BOT
The bot was built using javascript. The idea was to use a web speech API to make it more interactive. However, it is not a
conversational bbut conventional chatbot and used to make people understand javascript in depth. If you have any doubts, kindly go through the code as the comments have been added explaining each line of code and you'll be good.
